Never say never.
Every dog has its day.
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Prevention is better than cure.
Once bitten twice shy.
His bark is worse than his bite.
Let well alone./Leave well alone.
Beggars can't be choosers./Half a loaf is better than no bread.
You must strike while the iron is hot./You must make hay while the sun shines.
Don't put all your eggs in the same basket.
There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Every cat in the twilight is grey
The early bird catches the worm.
Let the world say what it will.
Dog does not eat dog.
Still waters run deep.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Don't count your chickens before they're hatched./It's not over till the fat lady sings.
